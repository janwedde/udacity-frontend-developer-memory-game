## General

Memory Game is a browser-based card matching game.
The game is part of the Nanodegree program "Front-End Web Developer" of Udacity.
You can access the game here.

## Rules

The game consists of 16 cards with 8 different motives. 
The aim of the game is to reveal all 8 pairs of cards one after the other.

The game proceeds as follows: 

- The player turns over a first card by clicking on it.
- Now the player has to try to find a second card with the same motive.
- If the two face-up cards match, they remain face-up.
- If the two cards do not match, they will automatically turn around after a short time.

The star ranking 

- The game has a star rating. At the start three stars are displayed. 
- Each uncovering of 2 cards is counted as one move.
- After 8-13 moves, the number of stars is reduced to 2.
- After 14 or more moves, the number of stars is reduced to 1.

The game continues until the player has uncovered all 8 pairs one after the other. The player can restart the game at any time by pressing the reset button. The reset also resets the play time that starts when the player clicks for the first time. When the player has uncovered all card pairs, a pop-up informs him about his star ranking and the required game time.
